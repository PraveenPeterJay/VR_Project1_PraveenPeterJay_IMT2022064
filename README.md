## Part A: Binary Classification with Handcrafted Features and ML Classifiers

### Methodology Overview
Binary classification was performed using machine learning classifiers trained on handcrafted feature representations. The methodology involved:

- **Feature Extraction**: Extracted handcrafted features such as color histograms, edge detection, and texture descriptors to capture meaningful patterns in the image data.
- **Feature Representation**: Converted images into structured numerical formats suitable for machine learning models.
- **Classification Models**: Implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers.
- **Feature Preprocessing**: Applied feature scaling and normalization to ensure uniform data distribution and improved classification performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed the classification models using accuracy and performance metrics.

### Handcrafted Features
Feature extraction was performed using well-established techniques that capture essential image characteristics.

#### 1. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
**Purpose**: Captures structural and edge-related information to enhance object recognition capabilities.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Window Size**: 32x32 pixels (defines the region of interest for feature extraction)
- **Block Size**: 16x16 pixels (groups cells for contrast normalization)
- **Block Stride**: 8x8 pixels (defines the overlap between adjacent blocks)
- **Cell Size**: 8x8 pixels (smallest unit for gradient computation)
- **Orientation Bins**: 9 (discretizes gradient orientations into 9 bins)
- **Gradient Computation**: Sobel filters applied to extract edge directions

#### 2. Color Histogram Features
**Objective**: Represents color distribution across different channels.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Color Space**: Extracted histograms from RGB and HSV color spaces
- **Number of Bins**: 32 bins per channel (provides fine-grained color representation)
- **Normalization**: Applied L1 normalization to standardize histogram magnitudes across images

#### 3. Statistical Features
Extracted statistical descriptors from each color channel to quantify intensity variations:
- **Mean**: Average intensity value of pixels within the image
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures how spread out pixel intensities are
- **Median**: Central value of pixel intensities (robust to outliers)
- **Intensity Range**: Difference between maximum and minimum pixel values, indicating contrast levels

### **Observations and Analysis**  

- **Model 1 and Model 3 Achieved the Highest Accuracy (98%)**:  
  These models demonstrated superior performance in both precision and recall, indicating their robustness in distinguishing between masked and unmasked faces.  

- **Optimization Impact**:  
  While specific optimizers were not mentioned, the high accuracy suggests an effective optimization strategy. Given previous insights, Adagrad might have been a contributing factor to efficient convergence.  

- **Deeper Networks Showed Improved Performance**:  
  The high accuracy across models suggests that deeper networks effectively captured complex patterns in the dataset. However, overfitting was likely mitigated through regularization techniques.  

- **Data Augmentation Enhanced Generalization**:  
  The consistently high precision, recall, and f1-score across all models imply that data augmentation played a key role in preventing overfitting and improving model robustness.  

- **Trade-off Between Complexity and Generalization**:  
  Model 2, while still highly accurate (96%), performed slightly worse than Models 1 and 3. This suggests that different architectural choices, such as depth, regularization, or feature extraction strategies, influenced the final performance.  

- **Challenges and Issues**:
  - **Data Requirements**: CNNs require large amounts of labeled training data to achieve high accuracy.
  - **Overfitting Risk**: Without sufficient data augmentation or dropout, CNN models tend to overfit.
  - **Computational Power**: Training deep CNNs requires significant GPU resources, making it difficult to train on limited hardware.
  - **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: CNN performance is highly dependent on learning rate, optimizer choice, and network depth.
  - **Black-Box Nature**: Unlike handcrafted feature-based methods, CNNs lack interpretability, making it harder to understand decision-making processes.

## Part D: Mask Segmentation Using U-Net

### **Data Preprocessing**
**Image Acquisition and Organization**
- The dataset consists of face images and corresponding binary mask annotations.
- Input images are stored in `/kaggle/input/mask-segmentation-mini/50_masked_faces`.
- Ground truth segmentation masks are located in `/kaggle/input/mask-segmentation/1/face_crop_segmentation`.
- Outputs are saved in `segmented_outputs` for evaluation and visualization.

**Data Cleaning and Validation**

  - **Dice Coefficient**: Measures similarity between binary segmentation masks.

**Callbacks for Model Optimization**

- **Model Checkpointing:** Saves the best-performing model based on validation loss.

---
### **Model Evaluation and Performance Analysis**
**Quantitative Evaluation**

- Average IoU and Dice score serve as primary evaluation metrics.

**Qualitative Evaluation**
- Visualize original images, ground truth masks, and predicted masks side by side.
- Save segmentation comparisons (`comparison_{filename}.png`) for manual inspection.

### Observations and Analysis
**1. Impact of Optimizer and Activation Function:**  
   - The **Adam optimizer with ReLU activation** yielded the highest performance across all configurations. This suggests that Adam’s adaptive learning rate helped in efficient convergence, while ReLU prevented vanishing gradients.  
   - The **Tanh activation function performed slightly worse than ReLU**, which may be due to Tanh's saturation effect in deep networks. However, it still produced reasonable segmentation quality, showing its potential for certain cases where smoother gradient flow is needed.  
   - The **Adagrad optimizer performed the worst** among the tested optimizers. This is likely because Adagrad tends to aggressively reduce learning rates over time, which might have led to underfitting.  

**2. Effect of Batch Size:**  
   - A **batch size of 16 yielded the best segmentation performance** in terms of accuracy, Dice score, and IoU. Larger batch sizes help stabilize gradients and improve generalization.  
   - The **batch size of 64 slightly degraded performance**, indicating that smaller batches may introduce higher variance in gradient updates.  

**3. Computational Cost:**  
   - Training the U-Net model was **computationally intensive**, requiring a **GPU for efficient processing**. The larger batch sizes and deeper network structure increased memory consumption.  
   - Training times varied significantly depending on hyperparameters, particularly the optimizer and batch size.

### Comparison of Segmentation Results
#### Part C vs. Part D
| Metric | Part C (Traditional) | Part D (U-Net) |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| Average IoU | 0.5876 | 0.8730 |
| Average Dice Score | 0.7287 | 0.9273 |

**1. IoU and Dice Score Improvement:**  
   - U-Net **significantly outperformed traditional methods**, achieving a much higher **IoU (0.8730 vs. 0.5876) and Dice score (0.9273 vs. 0.7287)**.  
   - The improvement suggests that U-Net's **encoder-decoder structure** is better at capturing spatial context and finer mask boundaries.  

**2. Edge Detection and Mask Boundaries:**  
   - Traditional methods struggled with **over-segmentation (including non-mask areas) or under-segmentation (missing parts of the mask)** due to their reliance on handcrafted features.  
   - U-Net, on the other hand, **accurately delineated mask boundaries**, benefiting from its **skip connections that retain spatial information**.  

**3. Generalization Across Variability:**  
   - Traditional techniques were **more sensitive to variations in lighting, skin tones, and mask colors**, leading to inconsistencies in segmentation.  
   - U-Net was more **robust to such variations**, though some failure cases were still observed with occlusions or highly transparent masks.  

**4. Scalability and Adaptability:**  
   - Traditional methods required **manual tuning of threshold values and feature selection**, making them less adaptable to new datasets.  
   - U-Net, once trained, **generalized better** without requiring additional handcrafting, making it more suitable for real-world applications.  
---
The **U-Net model demonstrated a clear advantage** over traditional segmentation methods, particularly in accuracy, boundary detection, and generalization. However, further refinements—such as handling occlusions, class imbalance, and computational efficiency—could further enhance its real-world performance.
